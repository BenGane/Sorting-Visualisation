# Sorting-Visualisation
This is my first attempt at visualising different sorting algorithms in Java. I made this visualisation to show the beauty of sorting algorithms. You can modify all major features of the program using the Constants class.

## Algorithms 
I have implemented a visualisation for each of the following algorithms:
* Quick sort
* Merge sort
* Insertion sort
* Selection sort
* Bubble sort
* Cocktail shaker sort
* Odd-even sort

## Running The Visualisation
This project requires Java 11.0.4 or above, and Gradle 5.6.1 or above.<br>
To run the application, navigate to the root of the project folder and
execute gradle run in a terminal.<br>
